**&lt;Frank Vocatura Status Report Week (4)&gt;**

##Project Summary

Carbon Emissions have been a focal point for enterprises to combat climate pollution. Regulations have been getting stricter and us as consumers wish for sustainability. By having a platform to monitor, visualize and create strategies for emissions reduction.

Use AI to create a platform to monitor emissions, simulate strategies and automate reporting. Gain knowledge of using open-source technologies to create this platform (satellite imagery, IoT sensors etc.) Of course, gain extensive knowledge with training LLMs and AIs.

##Team Members – (Hours Worked on Project)

Frank – 7-10hrs

##Completed Tasks from Last Week – (Task Owner)

Researched tools and tech to be used in the project

Heavy focus on being able to take in vast knowledge of AI and RL

Wrote several Python scripts to get practice on the language since it’s been awhile

Started some rough designs in Figma, probably going to use multiple tools like UXpin and Uizard

Finished a rough draft of UI/UX.

WebScraper and License detector both finished projects.

##Planned Time** **Actual Time** **Remaining Hours in Budget

15hrs 7-10hrs ~8hrs

##Planned Tasks for Next Week – (Task Owner)

More work on UI/UX Design.

ERD and prep for midterm presentation

Drill down a design plan even though I imagine it will change substantially once I actually start to implement certain features

Start/Finish quick AI projects(llama webscraper for practice with streamlit and a License plate detector with MatLab). This will probably be pushed a couple of weeks to do design stuff first.

Start researching the model in Hugging Face and begin RL process.

Begin leveraging Hugging Face to start coding parts.

Status Reports/Compendium updates

##Project Risks – (High, Medium, Low)

Some tools require a hefty amount of knowledge and time (Low since I am starting this process now)

Some tools require a subscription(?)(Medium)

Getting a good design down for website (High, but easily completed)

##Overdue Tasks

At this point, nothing really

##Issues

Design

##Follow-up Actions – (Responsible Person)

Research design

Research AI and working with it

Mistral/Baseline3

Begin working with the model.
