**&lt;Frank Vocatura Status Report Week (7)&gt;**

##Project Summary

Carbon Emissions have been a focal point for enterprises to combat climate pollution. Regulations have been getting stricter and us as consumers wish for sustainability. By having a platform to monitor, visualize and create strategies for emissions reduction.

Use AI to create a platform to monitor emissions, simulate strategies and automate reporting. Gain knowledge of using open-source technologies to create this platform (satellite imagery, IoT sensors etc.) Of course, gain extensive knowledge with training LLMs and AIs.

##Team Members – (Hours Worked on Project)

Frank – 10-15hrs

##Completed Tasks from Last Week – (Task Owner)

Researched tools and tech to be used in the project

Heavy focus on being able to take in vast knowledge of AI and RL

Started some rough designs in Figma, probably going to use multiple tools like UXpin and Uizard

Finished a rough draft of UI/UX.

Work on design

Work on Activity diagrams – Refining this because I need to make it more clear

GNATT Chart

Heuristic Eval

##Planned Time** **Actual Time** **Remaining Hours in Budget

15hrs ~15hrs 0hrs

##Planned Tasks for Next Week – (Task Owner)**

Work on visualizing data

Work on use cases

Completed a more comprehensive version of my WireFrame

Work on all Wiki and Final Presentation

##Project Risks – (High, Medium, Low)

Some tools require a hefty amount of knowledge and time (Low since I am starting this process now)

Some tools require a subscription(?)(Medium)

Getting a good design down for website (High, but easily completed)

Working on Scope(Med)

Keep up to date on GNATT Chart(Med-low)
