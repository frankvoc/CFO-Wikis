##Project Summary

Carbon Emissions have been a focal point for enterprises to combat climate pollution. Regulations have been getting stricter and us as consumers wish for sustainability. By having a platform to monitor, visualize and create strategies for emissions reduction.

Use AI to create a platform to monitor emissions, simulate strategies and automate reporting. Gain knowledge of using open-source technologies to create this platform (satellite imagery, IoT sensors etc.) Of course, gain extensive knowledge with training LLMs and AIs.
