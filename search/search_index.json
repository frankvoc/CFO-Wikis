There will be error pages and catching. Match between system and the real world There will be familiar UI/UX elements used in this project. The map will be tested and have a great feeling when using it. User control and freedom There are \u2018back buttons\u2019 at pivotal points and there will be validation on all forms that checks before submissions so errors will be caught and the user will be notified. Consistency and standard There is a standardized style in this application. Error prevention There are error pages and form validation at every point necessary in the application. Recognition rather than recall The elements will be easy to recognize and what they will be used for. Flexibility and efficiency of use Any user will be able to navigate the application. An aesthetic and minimalist design This design is minimalistic and easy to navigate. It will not be cluttered. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors There will be error messages and status codes from requests.

Regulations have been getting stricter and us as consumers wish for sustainability. By having a platform to monitor, visualize and create strategies for emissions reduction. Opportunity: Use AI to create a platform to monitor emissions, simulate strategies and automate reporting. Gain knowledge of using open-source technologies to create this platform (satellite imagery, IoT sensors etc.) Of course, gain extensive knowledge with training LLMs AIs. Users In a perfect world my platform would be used by supply chain management and suppliers (and more). Supply chain management roles would be to optimize logistics and strategies, balancing cost and efficiency. The platform proposed would help companies manage carbon emissions, cost and risk. Using this platform will utilize RL to simulate managing suppliers to find a good balance between cost and emissions. For example, a workflow could look something like using the platform to analyze suppliers, run a simulation using RL to reroute shipments to avoid an extremely high emission scenarios, then moving to that new supplier. Suppliers\u2019 role is to provide said materials to larger enterprises and compete with others on emissions and cost (mainly cost). With the growing pressure on sustainability, some suppliers may focus more on emissions. With the platform suppliers could use tools like an emission calculator to assess these factors.
